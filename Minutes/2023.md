        * Overall people were happy and stressed need to be ethical.

* AOB

**Notes**



* Issue 9 Threat Modeling doc - Henrik
    * After [@CRob](https://openssf.slack.com/team/U01V4K5JFKK) suggested to give all threats identifiers, I started numbering them C1-C6 (for those that relate to incoming data flows) and I1 onwards for those after initial access has been obtained through C1-C6
    * Threats C1-C6 have been reviewed. I did a bit of additional polishing, but I do not think they require (much) additional work.
    * Threats I1-I8 are in relatively good shape, except for the enumeration of respective controls, which does not look complete, but should otherwise be good for initial review.
    * There are also other minor changes across the initial sections (highlighted in suggestion-mode).
    * Looking at NIST CI/CD doc to see what is interesting/useful to the project
    * Will start with next batch of threats for next week
    * Anyone interesting in reading and providing feedback - comments welcome
    * Georg - many people have express problems accessing google docs.  Do we want to document that and perhaps compile information to assist those members in pleading their case 
    * CRob - consider putting TH paper into GH sooner so that more folks can review/contribute (w/o “google firewall rules”)
* Atlantic Council Paper: Driving Software Recalls: Manufacturing Supply Chain Best Practices for Open Source Consumption
    * Open for feedback

* Scribe - Dan A.
* New Friends
* Issue #24: [Threat Modeling Blog](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/09/27/threat-modeling-the-supply-chain-for-software-consumers/) is up! Discuss.
    * Post is out; process is to get consensus in group and then send to Jen Bly, ping the TAC… A few comments and feedback already.
    * Please get the word out and channel feedback.

    * Conferences; CISOs, reaching out to LF and OSSF member companies to raise awareness of End User group.. We've drafted an email… 
    * We’re looking for end users - and LF community has lots. 
* RFI - from I3 - US Govt has raised a RFI about securing Open Source Software
    * White house / us fed gov RFI [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OS3I-RFI-Embargoed-Until-08102023-0500EST.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OS3I-RFI-Embargoed-Until-08102023-0500EST.pdf)
    * Jon is channeling End User feedback into a reply from OSSF - if people are interested in adding to that.
    * Response date extended to november.
* Issue #25 : Create [MVSR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6hOlE4eH1xvQ9pP7swCH2tmIJJ-6G3vnYI8MDzSCQk/edit#heading=h.h9d3nj3ybue3) for End User WG [ Jon]

* Issue # 19: [Threat Modeling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLCsT0a5vp6FcvquWPzx8AzhFMORyw-4rd9WSyUO9zI/edit?usp=sharing) Document [Henrik]
    * Maybe  have the content separated and have some of the volunteers take up those specific sections to do review and accept suggestions?
    * Need to split the work to people…
    * Henrik: not much feedback on the changes from August… Splitting this in chunks and having them reviewed…  Review required for threat descriptions / threat tables.
    * Dan: lots of tracked changes stuff… feels like someone needs to accept the changes.. Suggest creating a named version and then accepting the changes and we review the version with accepted changes…
    * Henrik: to produce a version without tracked changes…
    * JM: time-line for review?
    * Henrik: until next call - 2 weeks?
    * JM: Sounds alright.
    * JM: people adopting a section… 
    * JM: there’s really decent data in that doc now… 
* Working Group Notes
    * AI/ML
        * Dan outlines the “security telemetry” paper - in process - [AI Security Telemetry - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J8M1F5ev9tXzMpA3dAFXqXYs2t-T10xt0_ObXnqNN04/edit?pli=1)

            Issue around traceability of metadata - particularly license metadata

        * JM: concerned about potential litigation because of artifacts created by AI - and legal license 
        * Abdullah: expands the scope of license.
    * JM: summit in Washington DC - CISA, whitehouse, OpenSSF… etc…
        * 1st day - us govt reiterating their deep interest in open source security
        * Asking for feedback to the RFI…
        * Panel including financial services - capital 1, jpmc, fs-isac – showing how financials services think about OSS security… While some of the larger players are thinking about this, not all financial institutions have that level of resource… Realisation - how to provide those capabilities in a consumable way. Fs-isac has a supply chain working group - JM chairs - open group financial services…
        * In the OpenSSF we are at the bleeding edge - we need to get the information out.
        * One of the key things is repo security - SCM guide has been published which is one answer to that. [OpenSSF Releases Source Code Management Best Practices Guide - Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/09/14/openssf-releases-source-code-management-best-practices-guide/)
        * 
* AOB
    * Abdullah: Any work going on on securing package managers - e.g. NPM? Given its relevance to the usage of open source… are alpha/omega groups looking at that?
        * [package-manager-best-practices/published/npm.md at main · ossf/package-manager-best-practices (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/published/npm.md#readme) (But that’s aimed at developers using NPM rather than working to secure NPM itself)
        * Jacques: a alpha-omega initiative - securing repos group -; at least ruby gems [has received STF funding](https://rubycentral.org/news/stf-announce/)… that’s helped fund a lot of operational support…
    * Nour: threat modeling - deciding one what tools to use and **experience of using those tools** for an end user. What it’s like to use the openSSF tooling at scale. What problems are you solving it and what problems are people facing when using this tooling.
        * Dan: very valuable to explore the experience of tools; and the “real world problem”
        * JM: now there is enough maturity with use of vendor and open source tools - there is experience - but where are the gaps?
        * Nour to turn this into a proposal… we need to agree level of detail we want to get into and whether this is right forum…
        * JM: some sensitivities… 
        * Abdullah: rank in terms of effort - which of these practices require a higher effort? Guidance from low effort to higher effort…
        * JM: the “security toolbelt” view [is more abstract]
        * Nour: I’m thinking of the experience of developers actually using open ssf tooling - start with SigStore - what problems can be solved by sigstore and what are potential issues right now? Start with OpenSSF (open source) tools. For example - some of these services might be logging data that end users don’t want them to log. That’s one angle.

    8. Jay: S2C2F has threats… list of threats & controls - that’s increasing
    9. Chris: JavaScript security task force has work on threat models we should consider for the language? Something on our backlog. Also some overlap with Compiler Hardening work.
    10. Crob: on tool-belt - e.g. Henrik’s paper and this groups threat model will be resources toolbelt group will use. Looking to do some proof-of-concept - maybe could work with the JS folks… see how it applies to JS.

    14. Represented by  👍
    15. Feedback / update Jeff & Crob?
    16. Representatives from different working groups… we did a show & tell … Crob intends to do a write-up - will schedule 2 follow-up meetings including 1 in Spain (OpenSSF Day Europe, tbc). Next steps: where do we see overlap, where are their opportunities for collaboration? Most every group are touching on end users… but may not realize… 
* Issue 25: Create MSVR [Jon, Crob]
    17. Request for help
    18. Looking for help to work on the MSVR - OpenSSF asking all groups to work on this - roadmap are tangible actions… e.g. delivering the manifesto…  Some good examples from Best Practices wh - and Vulnerability Disclosures…  Some of the content exists but needs to be brought together…
    19. Time-line : end of September
    20. Nour to help.

        * Looking for input
    26. Chris: looking for additional input on GitLab coverage for the SCM guide… 
    27. Annapurna: Alpha-Omega having an in-person conference coming up to hash out MVSR for the group. Mentorship program is coming to an end - a blog post is coming up.
    28. Nour: best practices for supply chain tools… 
        * What it’s like to use supply chain products / tools at scale … to solve problems… 
        * Guidance
        * Potential issues that could be raised… e.g. what the considerations of using sigstore as an end user?
        * Any supply chain tools…
        * Including vendor tools…?
        * Dan: maybe keep vendor neutral but still would be useful to hear about challenges integrating between vendor tools and open source tools.
        * Crob: with the toolbelt we have a list of capabilities - each supported by a series of patterns (e.g. fuzzing) - and then you can find an open or closed tool that will be an example of that implementation. An enterprise has to have that blending of commercial an open tools…. No completely homogenous environment.
* Action Items
    29. **Action**: Dan to look at End User personas and map back to toolbelt personas.
    30. **Action**: Nour collecting feedback on best practices for supply chain …

35. Vulnerability Disclosure WG - Maintainers and researchers , one focused on consumers would be a great addition to the focus groups.
    
37. CROB has a project proposal. Here is the link to the issue raised.
  * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/115](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/issues/115)
      
39. Where can we add value to OpenSSF or Open Source community?
  * David E- Go to TAC and get the feedback that are the specific info or policy or regulation impacts , in general as a group tap into other WG requirements and coordination, learn out to participate and to contribute directly or provide feedback as would add value to openssf and Open Source community. WG as “kitchen cabinet” for TAC and resource to bounce ideas or questions from the TAC or other WGs.
  * Nour - High stake testers would like to provide feedback, productionising those products, would like to submit some PRs, or highlight the issues we are facing.

Gives a great end user perspective of using the OSSF tooling or other tools and services. Put an issue for this.

* CRob- Project sterling Tool chain ( [security Tool Belt](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/tree/main/SecurityToolbelt)) focusing on developer consumers or consumers and embedded into the effort, to bring the similar perspective. Going to have a [strategic alignment summit](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/186) to address the lack of coordination. Welcome all to watch the meeting or join it and participate, an opportunity to learn what's going on and provide your feedback 

There is also a 1.5 hour white board session in Bilbao as follow up.

* Outreach	
37. Andrew A was working on this. Approaches to reach out to other end users and enterprises to engage.
38. Not many people are attending the live sessions, not many active participants. Jon M raised an Issue on this.
39. CRob - To Take action to drop notes on other WGs, and meetings?, informing of the WG and requesting others to participate. Consider going to conferences, doing "birds of a feather" with other oss consumers.
40. Georg K - Is on Todo group and would like to use it to promote this WG. Encourage others to participate in the todo group as well.
41. CRob -Intel will be presenting at OSS-EU OSFDay about our experiences implementing Scorecard.We can probably get time to help out at the OSSF booth at conferences, where we can rep the team as well.
42. CRob BP C/C++ Compiler Hardening [Guide ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/Compiler-Hardening-Guides)(to be published sometime later this year)
43. CRob BP SCM [Guide ](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/docs/SCM-BestPractices)(to be launched at OSSF Day 18Sept)
44. CRob BP [Memory Safety SIG](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety)CRob  (will be proposing a W3C-style workshop to discuss how to implement tools, techniques and m.s. Languages to improve the ecosystem
45. David E - [Securing Critical Projects](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects)

* Notes:
    57. Additional threats:
        * Does the source code artifact used for the build match the repository?  What is the assurance that the source code downloaded to the hermetically sealed build system matches the repository? The repository could generate a fake signature for the tagged point to match the signature of the artifact.
        * A user could add malware to the build, especially proprietary changes to the Open Source base (malware can be built SLSA 4 compliant)?
        * Scanning malicious software from package managers at delivery. Send additional metadata.

    58. Nour Bösing from Spotify
* [Jacques] Issue 5: ingestion manifesto was presented to TAC
    59. Manifesto has gone to the TAC for review…  [wg-end users/MANIFESTO at main · ossf/wg-end users (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/tree/main/MANIFESTO) They seemed to like but had a lot on their agenda… If and when we decide to do a blog post we should inform the TAC
* One outstanding comment… Jeff is working on.
* We’ve adopted it in the End User wg… 
* Brian: regulatory pressure in europe (CRA) and from the white house (liability directive): putting liability somewhere other than the end user - as a regulatory thing. The consumption reframes it that there is a role for the end user - a positive upstream role as well in requesting for better security. This could be used in a policy-oriented context. Could be positioned in opposition to those trends.
* Annapurna: next steps?
* J: next steps are final polish and then a blog post…
* Brian: suggest sharing it with regulatory “crowd” focusing on CRA…
* Jeff: this is part of the intent - also backed by data. E.g. in Sonatype annual software supply chain report - for all downloaded vulnerabile components - only 4% were “no fix available”. This cuts against “open source isn’t doing its job.”
* Brian: signatories?
* Jeff: first the group (end user wg)...
* J: we could add a signatories section… Governance committee?
* B: there would be power to involving the governing board.  We could raise it at the _governance committee_. (meets next week)
* Crob: TAC could raise it… The TAC didn’t have objections.
  
* **General agreement**

* Brian: September is next target from a CRA perspective. Would be good to get this out and especially signed by European companies…
* Brian: current agreed draft of the CRA has some pieces we don’t like… 
* Dan: can we make the point that this is a consensus draft?
* _some discussion on whether this is ok_
* Crob: one thing the group should do - some of our process and organization is loose - we could adjust this group’s charter and talk about how we consider people to be members of this group… we could tweak the charter.
* _Some discussions on charter: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/blob/main/CHARTER.md](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/blob/main/CHARTER.md) and what the charter states about consensus and decision making_
* Annapurna: might take some more time to make it more formal / validity… 
* Brian: some work to do on governance… we should come back with some ideas on how to do this rather than each group coming up with its own…
* Crob: this group we’re not writing code so the github metric is not as helpful but we could make it you need to be a member in good standing by commenting on 3 issues a year or something like that…
* Brian: we can say this is an informal product and there is a consensus view of those who have joined the calls that this is good – I know we will get suggestions for revision… We’ll have some editing work to do. This is a good starting point.
* **brian to raise at the governing committe**
* Taking further discussion to [https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/issues/5](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/issues/5) 
* Reports from other WGs
    60. 
* AOB
    61. End user wg at OpenSSF / OpenSource Summit Europe day  - will try to have a bof session or similar.
    62. Anna: how do we get more people to participate / get the word out?
* J: will do a call for end users… at openssf day / opensource summit europe
* Brian: blog posts - they do get read - more impactful than even a talk at OpenSSF day… If someone can write about their experience as an end user org, personal story, that would be great.
* Crob: I can connect anyone with Jennifer Bly to get that on the official blog docket.
* J: we haven’t had a single end user experience report yet… 
* Nour: would like to work on that - need collaborators - one issue would be how much of our data would be public to everyone?
* Dan: some parallels to the SBOM everywhere discussions about confidentiality in SBOMs…
    63. Brian: the refining architecture & threat model SIG - the threat models document that David Wheeler is working on - any report from them?
* Anna: I do - we do have the notes here… [OpenSSF Threat Models - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLCsT0a5vp6FcvquWPzx8AzhFMORyw-4rd9WSyUO9zI/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)  Looking for hands on SMEs that make it more robust. Is there a specific report?
* Crob: there is a presentation - we spent time focusing on large commercial enterprise… Jonathan just added some new ideas for threats.  We’re iterating on that. Need more people who have a threat modeling background.
* Brian: **Blog post?**
* **Crob to take action to talk to Henrik and Jonathan**

    * Update / New threats
    * Upcoming meetings will be on Mondays (moving from Tuesdays)
    * Thinking about when to move to markdown on GitHub, though with PDF generation
    * Level of detail, as looking at particular techs there is a rabbit hole each time
    * Expecting to add another 10 threats. Reality is that there’ll be multiple threat models at multiple granularities. That’s still useful at each level. Original usage was high-level but low-level threats have been more fleshed out.
    * Concern about how long it’s taking. Timebox?
    * Still looking for assistance and help
    * CRob recommends [Shostak’s Threats book](https://threatsbook.com)
* [Issue #13](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/issues/13) - asking S2C2F SIG to give an update
    * Gauge interest?
    * Jay White: always looking for more folks to be involved. Making improvements. We could do a formal update, had in mind to do one for Supply Chain Integrity WG’s presentation to TAC next week.
        * Two additional threats from feedback so far. Would welcome any other threats found during modeling work.
    * Reciprocal visits? Jonathan will be on holiday but could visit S2C2F after that.
* Reports from other WGs
    * Jacques: Great Repository Audit work in progress. Waiting on funding decision from A-O.

<h4>Notes:</h4>




* Logistics
    * JC: Raising items for agenda out of the github repo. Feel free to open end issues on the repo with thing you want to discuss..
* Ingestion Manifesto
    * Jeff - recall - we need to explain a bit further - not like how a physical recall works but related… as opposed to the defacto approach today - ship with an SBOM and customer looks through it. Customer tracking consumption of OSS - we can add that in, we can remove the recall language… 
    * JC: I think it causes more confusion than gain … follow the analogy 
    * Dan: yeah support the idea of removing recall but continuing the spirit - 
    * Jeff: spirit is driving it communication it through number of pipelines / channels about something that may be unsafe … I will re-word to capture the spirit.
    * Crob: technologies like VeX - describe that there’s a problem - good citizen of the OSS community. Using VeX to signal downstream… 
    * Jeff: responsibility of the manufacturer… the cbd process … how do you even begging ot start that disclosure process…
    * **Action** taken by Jeff to re-word.
* Threat Model
    * JC: placeholder for the work being done in the SIG…  [Working doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLCsT0a5vp6FcvquWPzx8AzhFMORyw-4rd9WSyUO9zI/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) we need more people. New time for it… 
    * Henrik: [doodle](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/b2WRR7vd) is open… until friday tomorrow. Looks like Monday 6:30 European Summer time will be new time. We’ll start with this in July (starting 10th if Monday is confirmed).
    * [discussion of maybe starting week after due to july 4 long weekend in US]
    * Henrik: we developed and discuss threats together… John added another  another bunch of threats. We have 20-something different threats… 
    * Crob: I’ve been participating - I would encourage everyone to take a look at the work. Please participate if you can.
    * JC: How do we see this fitting into the initiative formerly known as sterling tool chain.
    * Crob: I think this will be the 2nd next step - we will be deciding on security architecture principles. And we will do a threat model exercise. I think this work will accelerate that work.
    * Crob: [summary of sterling toolchain / toolbelt / utility belt] the work on an overall strategy for the OpenSSF - developing a reference architecture for how Open Source Software should be developed, managed and consumed. Gives an opportunity to identify existing work. Partners can fill these needs identified in the architecture. Unifying idea of how we can motivate the work of the foundation going forward.

* Technical Charter
    * JC: Issue opened to update the charter? Lacking context at this point.
    * Annapurna: Jon said we could open an issue to for this - anyone can take a look at the charter - review. Compared to other OpenSSF charters.. Anything that makes it more specific - more detail - would be helpful.
    * Crob: Things like the charter and the group’s readme file are invaluable to document what the group is doing - entice new users to come in. And let’s get stuff in the readme so people get a clear understanding. 
    * Annapurna: …guidelines…keep it clean and open to everybody … free of bias.
    * JC: any specific thoughts and concerns?
    * Annapurna: maybe a spike session to work on it? Just a single meeting.
    * Dan: support adding detail to the charter - happy to help.
    * JC: most groups are operating on pure consensus… I’m worried about irreconcilable dispute that needs to be settled by vote. We should do some housecleaning and definitely fill in the blanks. The other question of whether it’s representative of reality.. Good rules help to make good decisions.
    * Crob: working groups have worked through and adopted charters - we adopted the template. Working group is empowered to make any adjustments. Document how the group wants to operate. Gives structure of what the rules of the road are. Sometimes you do need to document how to vote. E.g. adopting donated intellectual property. If we don’t need that we can just say “we’re consensus driven” - decide how to operate.
    * Andrew: Aren’t there standard ways to operate?
    * Crob: the template - everyone uses - but in this group we didn’t change it - we want to follow the spirit - e.g. the code of conduct - but how we make decisions is up to the group to decide.
    * Dan: I can make an initial edit and make a PR for us to review next meeting.
* Working Group Reports
    * Jay: **S2C2F** - those conversations are heating up. We’ve been going over it last 2 to 3 meetings. We’ve got SLSA 1.0 in the ecosystem. We can put some muscle / thought leadership behind S2C2F. Every other tuesday at 12 pacific time. New threats added. And start of an FAQ. Relevant to end users - consumer focused framework. 
    * Crob: **Best working group**.. Working on 2 new guides - one is about c/c++ compiler hardening … other guide of interest is source code management concise guide. Talking about how to use github and gitlab. Patches / feedback welcome. Will get wrapped up to 1.0 in July. We have github and gitlab fairly well documented. We want to get contributions for how to deploy similar controls.

    * … Education SIG has a DE&I committee. – engaging historically underrepresented folks in cybersecurity. They’ve been running som office hours.
        * Jay: addresses young people who want to study our craft - but also those who are looking at a career change. Help people find different paths into the industry. Office hours are a place for people to get info. Our meeting are an indicator [of diversity issue]. Please join the office hours and help. Many people are getting value out of these meetings. You can help. These are also good recruiting grounds… for people to join our SIGs…

Please submit a PR or open an issue if you have feedback.
    * One-day **workshop around CSAF and VEX** - in July - CSAF is electronic means by which vendors provide security advisories. Hand in hand with that is VEX vulnerability exchange. Cisco will sponsor this workshop: [https://vexsummit.org/](https://vexsummit.org/) 
    * Another CISA area - foundation participating with **CISA and JCDC** - conducting a workshop around use of open source in operational technologies and industrial control systems - e.g. critical infrastructure. If you’re in this space I encourage you to reach out: 
    * JC: Update from **securing software repositories** group - work proceeding. Basic model envisaged - by invitation ask repos to participate in the audit - funding for remediation. 
        * Annapurna - any specific criteria?
        * JC: some fuding givem to PiPi - it’ll come down to willingness from participants. Will pick one or two to begin with and roll out over time. We want people to hear about this and then come to us to join.
    * Annapurna: **alpha & omega** - rust kernel.. Openssl… some engagements… Please provide feedback. New web site from last month.
    * Crob: FIRST - representing vendor security teams and corporate security teams - they are pondering **creating a new conference**. Get groups like FIRST that manage CVSS .. get them, get OASIS, CVE board, CNAs… several day conference for early next year specifically focusing on vulnerability management, communications, tools, standards. If anyone interested in participating please reach out to me. Standardization of these things will be useful. 
    * Dan: Secure the web forward workshop [Workshop overview - W3C Workshop Secure the Web Forward](https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/) happening in September 26-28 - paper submission deadline end of July. Encourage people to participate.

            * single release of a "white paper"
    * Discussion: distributed vs. centralized use of git (e.g., GitHub, Gerrit, GitLab)
        * The typical use case in organizations is the centralized deployment
        * According to Jacques, different Git workflows and practices influence change request size and the “cost of response”
        * We may want to add a statement / disclaimer that we are intending to address a common/typical use case of git in organizations, but not mandating that a centralized deployment is the right approach.

<h4>Notes:</h4>




* New friend: Nitin from ADP
* Membership 
    * At LF openssf day morgan stanley committed to have someone; boeing expressed interest;
* LF Summit debrief
    * A couple of panels - where we talked about OpenSSF… One that Jacques, Andrew and ? presented in - in a room of 50 people there were 3 “end users” - so we need to grow this group. We need more end users in OpenSSF in general.
    * Andrew also participated in a panel with IBM and JPMorgan about software supply chain security… This talk was in the broader stream. Widely varying degree of knowledge on the topic. Need to keep raising awareness - especially to varying degrees of expertise.
    * Sessions were well attended.
    * Crob: a good set of microconferences and conferences; we lost some folks at OpenSSF day in the afternoon; the panel really highlighted the need to get broader feedback from end user constituency; some of us working on threat model - setting up a **survey** could help to lure more participation.
    * Jonathan hosted a BoF session - one outcome was pitching the OpenSSF to get some project management and marketing support. Plan is to for Andrew, Jacques and Crob to make a proposal to the leadership.
    * Crob - some events coming up ossf europe; japan
    * Dan: any definition of software supply chain security?
    * Crob: work starting on a dictionary / resource guide… Patches welcome.
    * Jay: 5 or 6 different areas - objective; mission; scope… we are strapped for time; idea is to build a working group that works with other working groups; personas; taxonomy, de&i, act as a liaison across the LF.. Document started months ago but we need help.
    * Gaja: more a glossary - guidance - main requirements… 
    * Dan: glossary is for the wider community - or should be - developers who potentially don’t know about security…
    * _some discussion on SLSA_ 
    * Jay: some work has gone already on a guide that includes S2C2F and SLSA… some gaps … could be further developed
* OSC Manifesto Comments
    * Jeff: at the summit we had some conversations - pitched the manifesto a couple times. It’s pushed to github - version 0.
    * Action for more comments… let’s give it another week.
    * Jacques: **Next meeting let’s take a vote.**
    * Jeff will send a draft for the potential blog.
    * Dan: signatories?
    * Jeff: intent is to bring this in to the End User wg and let that be the “signatory”... 
* SCM Guide update
    * Roberth - just came out of OSPO europe meeting - can add this to the agenda for the next one… ; right now it’s github and gitlab; how can we add more SCMs?
    * Crob: intention to make this a multi-use document; team has experience in github and gitlab; bur we need expertise ; patches welcome;
    * Jacques: relationship to other openssf work - is there intersection with SLSA and scorecard?
    * Gaja - some of the members of our OSPO part of finos… can I raise it there?
    * Dan: I’m happy to be a funnel for that feedback.
    * Joshua: can have a discussion on how to engage with SLSA.
* TAC report
    * CRob: this wg has the opportunity to share its work to the TAC next Tuesday. There’s a google slide template. The broader foundation would love to know what this group is working on - especially on the manifesto; 
    * BEST WG will be presenting on same day; feel free to reuse this template:
    * [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1__sodEVdVkp9UNSPOW-9WxDz4JvSWWkKgNwQ5HQ_Diw/edit#slide=id.g13dc63f7ee3_0_114](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1__sodEVdVkp9UNSPOW-9WxDz4JvSWWkKgNwQ5HQ_Diw/edit#slide=id.g13dc63f7ee3_0_114) 
* “Sterling Toolchain” SIG kicking off soon
    * [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151) 
    * Doodle to help find time - [https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/ermrDRKd](https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/ermrDRKd) 
* AOB
    * Jay: S2C2F is picking up steam - SIG meetings every other Tuesday - 12 pacific; 3pm eastern … Adding new threats… We need end user community especially for this.

<h4>Agenda:</h4>




* Scribe
* New friends
    * Jim introduce and welcome Jay Benfiled from NYP, who works on Daggerboard and contributed to the SBOM discussions at the SBOM WGs.
    * Chris de Almeida who works on OSS at IBM
    * 
* Membership Update - reminder - please add your name to the current member list and any referrals you may have
    * Reminder to folks to update the spreadsheet at the top of the slack channel. We’re looking for referrals to more and diverse crowd of OSS end users, specifically, but not only from highly regulated industries.
        * You don’t have to be an OSSF member to join the group discussion.
* LF NA Summit
    * Andrew updates that LF NA is coming up.
    * List of people who are attending:
        * NAME
        * CRob
        * Georg Kunz
        * Amanda Martin (LF)
    * Andrew is presenting the End User group’s work at LF NA. Total presentation time is 25 minutes. Discussion what are the main issues end users would like to see addressed 
        * Jim updates about SBOMs and relationship between vendors and end-users. Challenge on using SBOM data for analytics, moving from static data to analytics and actionable data on supply chain. On the vendor side, they want to provide the customer the best data, but are challenged by their own organization tech stack, processes or willingness to expose the “dirty laundry”, Jay Benfield concurs with that and expands on that topic..
        * Crob attended the SIRT at RSA. a large part of the discussion was on SBOM intersection with VEX, open VEX and CSAF. in the near future end-users will have a LOT of data generated from SBOMs and the ability to provide risk assessment will be more much more difficult.
        * Crob sits on the public policy committee where  discussion about [CRA](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/)  took place. For folks doing business with the EU this may have an impact. 
        * Jacques shared the concerns of RubyGems towards the EA CRA and points that organizations should start working towards the impact of the regulation on package repositories and oss maintainers.
        * Jim shared this link on chat: “Federal agencies must only use software provided by software producers who can attest to complying with the government-specified secure software development practices, as described in the NIST Guidance,” OMB ordered. : ttps://[www.meritalk.com/articles/fed-ciso-derusha-flags-release-of-software-attestation-form/](http://www.meritalk.com/articles/fed-ciso-derusha-flags-release-of-software-attestation-form/) 
* AOB (Any Other Business)
    * CRob updates about the mobilization plan. An open invite to the end user group to participate in the TAC’s discussion around Sterling toolchain: [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151)
        * The idea behind the Sterling toolchain is trying to accelerate the value for both maintainers and consumers of OSS.
        * There isn’t yet a specific requirements
        * Looking end to end at supply chain security and understanding the gaps, such as in trust in OSS vendors/maintainers. 
        * Increase communication and trust in OSS supply chain security.
        * Jacques comments about it being hard to understand what the toolchain idea is exactly, and to make a decision about it. Is the foundation funds put in the right place if we develop tools in that toolchain? Or should we invest more in education and in places where no vendor is interested in funding?
        * Crob responds that the toolchain may not be a literal tools that are developed by the foundation
        * Jim agrees with Jacques' points and adds that the different tools that provide the “same” functionality (e.g. spdx and cyclonDX) adds tension to the end-users of OSS.
        * Dan agrees and adds that tools such as Scorecard can be used as metrics in other *commercial* tools, rather than the foundation develop more tools that may compete in the commercial space.
        * Randall questions how the OSS community will take to the foundation creating more tools. The foundation does not want to become a king-maker. The community may think that the foundation’s work isn't always sensitive to previous generations of security requirements and implementations. 
        * CRob invites more such perspectives on the TAC issues.
        * Jeffery affirms some of the points raised by Randall, that we should look at the community in layers and generations. For instance does “memory safety” mean that all c/c++ code should be re-written in rust or may that be opening up to new challenges? Can we look at other major efforts in the community to guide our work?
        * Jay agrees that the Sterling toolchain is not tools, but people and processes that the foundation introduces to the community. We are all volunteers, but also represent our organizations that govern the foundation. What may be beneficial for us is to go internally, have these discussions and get the buy-in outside-in, rather than inside out.
        * Jacques comments that not all participants in the call are in the governing board. It may be helpful for the folks that are in orgs that are represented in the governing board, but that shouldn’t be the only direction to take.
        * Jim points that there is a regulatory tsunami coming (EU, US regulations etc). There is an option to be kingmaker in the coming period of time and it may be the mandate of the foundation to cover this space, while there is no cover for it elsewhere.
        * CRob is doing a session on the mobilization plan at OSS summit NA.
    * The mobilization plan rewrite should include representatives from the end-users WG. One of the forces behind the creation of this WG was the lack of governing board members of OSS end-users.
    * Dan propose to setup some time or help facilitate the creation of a webinar on the EU CRA.
        * Jacques and Joshua suggest connecting with existing efforts such as this one: [https://linuxfoundation.eu/cyber-resilience-act](https://linuxfoundation.eu/cyber-resilience-act) 
    * CRob suggests to help facilitate any member of the end-user group iin need of representation with the TAC or the GB.

Possible Implementation of the Sterling Toolchain:

Notes:



* Membership drive update:
    * Andrew: ADB … and received commitments from Morgan Stanley; Mercedes has committed; Boeing also;
    * At OpenSSF day at Vancouver - 2 proposals accepted. One panel; one presentation but would like to turn it into a panel. We need to meet the diversity requirements - call for participation.
* “Omega Assurance Framework”
    * Michael: From Alpha-Omega Group
    * [presents [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RlCw4ROQ4UTmaZ_dvaHgj1EUs_Vj4ZxyXxVFHmaht-k/edit?usp=sharing)]
    * “Data that describes security quality of the open source software they use.”
    * Today we have scorecard metrics - but doesn’t do static analysis (e.g.)
    * Supposed to complement everything else.
    * Assertions & Policies - e.g. “a code review was completed by xyz”
    * Assertions use in-toto.io spec… (JSON)
    * Policies: e.g. “all packages are actively maintained”
    * API surface…. 
    * JM: as an end user we’re trying to consume / validate software … does this provide security attestation on top of that? Will Omega or OpenSSF create these assertions?
    * Site - [https://oafdev1.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/assertions/show?subject_uuid=0c6aa7ec-b271-4906-989a-4e32d1dcbba1](https://oafdev1.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/assertions/show?subject_uuid=0c6aa7ec-b271-4906-989a-4e32d1dcbba1) - tool that shows security issues in packages…
    * If part of your internal org you only want to trust assertions made by xyz parties - you can do that. If you only want to trust e.g. static analysis results that come from a specific tool.
    * [issued raised about mentioning vendors due to liability reasons…]
    * Michael: comfortable with expressing facts “ran this tool; got this result” 
    * Jacques: concerned about proliferation of similar things that store data…
    * “Am I allowed to publish the snyk code output?”
    * MS: yes this should be a platform… LF will have a place where you can go and say for xyz package give me interesting information… including the results of static analysis tools… do we give the raw static analysis results?  Does that help the attacker too much? Or just aggregated results?
    * JM: anything you’re looking for from the group?
    * MS: looking for feedback - is this useful?
* Manifesto - new version here [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jSYC3-GvsWn_Qfb6YQiU6QUT_rX5uOttU2geNjCYq0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jSYC3-GvsWn_Qfb6YQiU6QUT_rX5uOttU2geNjCYq0/edit) 
    * In the spirit of the agile manifesto.
    * JM: time-frame?
    * Jeff: looking to release sooner rather than later. By next call we’ll have a better answer.
    * Jeffrey: worried about “manifesto” due to current events.
* Architecture & Threat Modelling working session
    * JM: since last call - pretty much done with “large scale” example architecture for enterprises.. Now identifying key assets we’d need to protect, keys, source code & binaries flowing through these systems…
    * Should we include “insider threat” as one of the threat actors? Not at this time.
    * Have held off on small scale… focus on large scale to start with…
    * AG: next stage is threat modeling…
    * JM: going through the taxonomy… and looking at where different standards such and tools fit… Will be working through it in subsequent sessions.
    * AG: need comments from smaller companies / organizations.
    * Will get a meeting on the **community calendar**.
* Other groups?
    * JL: **in vulnerability disclosure SIG** - focusing on auto-fixing - automating the fixing of wide-spread vulnerabilities in OSS and generating pull requests… Generating PRs at scale.. Has created negative reactions from maintainers … to automated tooling to generating a PR to fix their code. There’s a spec I’ve written up foir an automated fix campaign.. SIG meetings every wednesday. [[meeting notes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QwN7yQXWGM2tJaostIRNqyZIhVceVlIyXqCrSdC4E8/edit#heading=h.2rnlkgm56d11)]. Spec defines it so any org can implement it…  No current way in GitHub to do private security advisories but github is shipping something soon.
    * JM: **SBOM Forum** - discussing potential changes to NVD - looking at how changes to the data schema could get a better result… Some good blog articles… 
    * Dan: SBOM everywhere is happening - let’s connect the dots - it’s in the tooling working group.

    * expected Morgan Stanley and hoping to see soon
    * We ought to have Healthcare, do folks have contacts they can talk to?
    * FinOs member meeting in London, OK’d to give an update there, opportunity to talk to folks
* [Jessica Marz] [Secure Software Guiding Principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y9c9hTTIrQtfWDtY6iNFHwUt2cv1lLj3ZW9DnxDKhJI/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Complementary with OSS Manifesto
    * Folks would take a pledge to improve overall security of software supply chain
    * Been drafting with variety of people
    * Goal would be to donate to OpenSSF as a charter or document to promote to members and followers
    * Draft comments wanted
    * Allan F: [CISA’s Director Easterly gave talk about secure-by-design](https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-director-easterly-remarks-carnegie-mellon-university) ([highlights](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/readout-director-easterly-visits-carnegie-mellon-university-calls-radical-change-technology-product)). Might be going for an industry-type pledge. Could Jessica talk to CISA staff and harmonize?
    * Feedback from legal departments definitely sought, as that may be a blocker for adopting the pledge for many folks
* [Jon Meadows] Working session on Architecture 
    * Aim to create ref architectures that resemble orgs of different sizes (small, large), which map to OpenSSF work and products.
    * Large model is a simplification of an existing threat model, meant to resemble large regulated org.
        * Has roles that don’t touch SDLC directly but influence it (eg incident responders, SREs etc)
    * Eddie Knight: is this going to be a recommendation?
        * Jon: Not as such, it’s an example of how a typical end user may have set up.
        * Eddie: if, in a controlled org, you directly pull from outside, you introduce a particular risk, would not be recommended.
        * Jon: yes, good advice, mostly the relationship is meant to be what folks _are_ doing vs _should_ be doing (inb4 “normative” and “descriptive”)
    * CRob: should be vendor tool agnostic, saying “Eg.” in front of tool names.
    * CRob: might want to represent maintenance and incident response impacts the workflow.
        * Jacques: maybe another diagram with same boxes and different lines
        * Abdullah Garcia: at large orgs it’s uncommon for incident responders to directly touch systems
        * Jon: who is the org? Do we need a backstory or user persona?
        * Abdullah: do we want a different view for low-regulation vs high-regulation organizations? Highly regulated org would have “quite a lot more lines” which would make it hard to follow the abstraction.
        * CRob: let’s not make perfect the enemy of the good, a _next_ step is to build out high-reg orgs, but capable security architects should be able to start with what we have
        * Abdullah: we can rely on CIS controls for small, medium, large orgs for insights into how to divide up
    * Tracy Ragan: there are lots of pipelines, shaped by architecture (jars, databases etc). Monolith vs microservices.
        * Jon: trying to keep abstract
        * Tracy: not sure if abstraction helps, folks are struggling with different kinds of artifacts. Work in CD Foundation is on CD events. Lots of discussion of this abstraction, but local architectures that can change picture. Hard to nail down a particular flow.
        * Jon: focusing on commonalities
        * Tracy: calling out compliance levels
        * Jacques: might map to SLSA, S2C2F etc. (Aside on progressive deployment muddling things even more)
        * Jon: yes, and implementation details may not even be represented in standards. “Do we need SLSA or SSDF?” etc.
        * Abdullah: calls to filling out threat model to see how it fits.
        * Jon: do we still do large/small models, or do we jump into particulars? Could expand out of control
        * Abdullah: if we have good enough, let’s go with it and iterate. Folks can give feedback as it is mapped to own environments.
        * Tracy: can share whitepaper, encouraging folks to study and share their examples.
    * Jon: moving to small org. This was difficult given heavyweightedness of the orgs in the EU WG.
        * Tracy: from tiny org but we’ve employed a lot of the tools in the large org.
        * Jacques: might not be most representative org, lots of folks are at very primitive level
        * Tracy: lots of folks need concrete guidance, what are the nuts and bolts?
        * Jon: some folks don’t even have bolts. What does the 2-person org care about? Maturity question is interesting, what does low-maturity vs high-maturity look like?
        * CRob: the lowest is one box, a dev’s laptop
        * Tracy: even someone on laptop can implement some practices. In CD Foundation had no luck so far in coming up with representative architecture.
        * Jon: also missing the case where org is not building software at all, just buying and operating.

    * [CRob] Upcoming TAC elections:
        * **Voter Eligibility (Electorate) Self-Nomination Process**
            * Any contributor to OpenSSF working groups or initiatives is eligible to participate in the election. Valid contributions include: commits or submitted pull requests via Github; public edits or comments on Google docs or other work products associated with OpenSSF; posting messages to any mailing list or on Slack; and beyond that any other form of positive engagement with OpenSSF activities. The form asks you for an example of your contributions; this is merely to make it easier for election observers and OpenSSF staff to validate. If you have in any way been involved in or care about OpenSSF, but are in doubt as to whether your contribution “counts”, please fill it out anyways, and we will follow up.
            * Deadline: March 12, 2023
            * [Voter Eligibility Self-Nomination Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgQdwnRH5nMLkYUDhuM7LYxUynairprGc_xAPIZm9SGaytfg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
        * **TAC Self-Nomination Process**
            * The OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is composed of seven total individuals, four of whom are elected annually. If you are interested in serving on the TAC, and qualify as an eligible voter as above, please complete the self-nomination form below,

        * **SCIR Self-Nomination Information and Process**
            * [Since early in its existence](https://openssf.org/blog/2020/10/07/openssf-seeks-security-community-individual-representative-for-governing-board/), the OpenSSF Governing Board has sought to ensure it gets adequate input from voices in the software security community who would otherwise not be at the table. We seek candidates for the Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR) who can represent those voices, while also being a subject matter expert in the field with their own set of perspectives. Familiarity with the different OpenSSF working groups and projects, and being able to dedicate the time to be sufficiently informed on the issues that arise in our monthly calls and ongoing discussions, is highly desired. It is also highly desired, but not required, that the SCIR be a contributor and thus eligible to vote in the election. 
            * Deadline: March 12, 2022

        * **2023 Election Process**

            The Election Process will be monitored by Election Officials (volunteers identified by the TAC). At the conclusion of the validation period, Election Officials will publish the complete list of candidates.

* Begin of overall election process: February 27
* TAC Self-Nomination Period: February 27 - March 12 (2 weeks)
* SCIR Self-Nomination Period: February 27 - March 12 (2 weeks)
* Voter Ballot Request Period: February 27 - March 12 (2 weeks)
* Validation Period: March 13 - March 19 (1 week)
* Nominees Announced: March 20

* **OSSF Vancouver** - many WG members will be there. We can use this as a recruitment opportunity. Possible BoF. Possible F2F.

    * Jacques: Tragedy of digital commons policy paper has had some impact.
    * JM: As people start to digest it could be a good topic to bring up next meeting. Strategy to address these issues.
    * Andrew: “requiring people who produce or sell to put software through series of tests” 
    * Brian: “We want to change contract law so EULAs can’t disclaim liability.” and similar words for “custodians of data” - held responsible for leaking data in shipping software. Different approach from the CRA. Says responsibility should be on the companies not where it is today.
    * JM: where will the standards and best practices be curated? Our group would likely want to participate in that.
    * Brian: last page talks about implementation; my view is there will be a number of different initiatives. It will look a lot like when NTIA kicked off … it calls on public/private collaboration. Referred to safe harbours standards - and other industry defined best practices - which could be read to include outputs of the OpenSSF.
    * JM: Can people put commentary into the Slack channel?
    * Open SSF Public Policy meeting tomorrow - led by intel. Meeting tomorrow. 
        * 
* **Vice Chair & Recruitment**
    * Andrew to step down as VC of End User wg… Looking for someone with deeper cyber security experience - ideally from an “end user” company. Propose Jacques Chester. 
    * JM: 2nds Jacque.
    * [several +1s on the zoom chat]
    * No objections so motion carried - Jacques to take on vice-chair role.
    * Andrew [on recruitment]: we need new members - end users. We need a healthcare participant. Regulated industries. Regular government participant.  Will be working on putting together a list with help of the group.
* **Open Source Consumption Manifesto ** - [Open Source Consumption Manifesto - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MhiTQ5j6P-p6Naqnj27NP70a1Uik154JZAzkQ4j3IFQ/edit) 
    * Brian - working on this for a while … some of the learnings from the Tahoe event … Our data shows 96% of the time people make bad choices … trying to put together a call to action … relevel the focus … We thought of the “agile manifesto” - that’s what we’re trying to do here. We don’t want to bikeshed every detail. It’s a call to action, not a specification. Those things are being defined. We want to highlight this growing problem.
    * JM: … get people to work to mitigate the important issues … 
    * [some discussion of the lessons from Log4J]
    * Piergiorgio: with new generative models … will this be part of open source consumption… helping you to write vulnerable code .. how would this be tackled?
    * JM: kind of separate - the manifesto more focuses on consumption of OS software.
    * [some discussion on AI]
    * Jessica: I’m really interested in this that has tentative working title of “secure software covenant” .. would this be an appropriate forum - throw it into a google doc?
    * [general view: yes]
    * Brian: the manifesto is “we need to do some things about this” the covenant can be a thing for people who are already enlightened. 
    * Jessical: what’s the time line?
    * Brian: we think it’s best coming from OpenSSF … and so bringing it here to this group is an attempt to get consensus - and then get it on the OpenSSF blog.
    * JM: as soon as we can - next couple of weeks. Also definitely complementary to the covenant. And I think this wg would be a good step for the covenant too.
    * Jay: Like this… I hope we take some time with this… a great opportunity to talk about what’s on the horizon .. make some predictions … that will help us forecast issues to come. Make sure it can leave and breathe for years to come. “This could happen if we don’t…”
    * Dan: yes and we should also not be too slow… putting a stake in the ground is useful.
    * JM: I think there’s a threat that people aren’t aware of… forward thinking makese sense here. But concerned that there’s not enough awareness here. Really raise the awareness.
    * Roberth: I was part of writing the [not sure] principles - version 1.0. We could have a versioned manifesto… 
    * Brian: i think versioning is a good idea. I look at this as a single issue manifesto - it can be useful because this is an area that doesn’t get enough attention. Leaning hard on this one issue. People are “waiting” for SBOMs… waiting for the world to solve the problem is not the right answer.
    * Jacques: I think it’s a great initiative… A good manifesto has hyperbole …  Short or long with a single manifesto. Agile manifesto. 
    * Brian: yes - we don’t want it to be all the things…  “can we agree, big picture”
    * [another example manifesto [The Extensible Web Manifesto](https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/)]
    * Andrew: Note: “Sterling toolchain” will be the focus of OpenSSF… we need to think how manifesto fits together with that vision.
* **Architectures**
    * _bumped to an ad hoc session_
    * Henrik: agenda item - when will it happen?
    * [discussion on dates]
    * Thursday the 9th - at 12:00 Eastern Time - 
* **Notes from Other Working Groups**
    * Crob: TAC election … any participant within OpenSSF is eligible to vote. You need a github ID. Anyone is welcome to self-nominate for the TAC itself. A concept of a community security representative - not affiliated with a GB organization … that’s also up for nomination / election. Reg done by March 12; voting at end of March. [links and more detail above]
    * End User wg gets to come to the TAC next tuesday to talk about progress and activities… [on 7th]
    * From Securing Software Repos group: how metadata and samples will work… no timeline.

    * Any updates since last call?
    * Jay: propose a joint SIG with Best practices, Supply Chain Integrity, and Diagrammers Society for uniformity of taxonomy and terminology across OpenSSF. 
        * Have discussed so far in other WGs. What do folks think?
        * Andrew A: is it a permanent SIG, temp?
        * Jay W: probably ongoing, since there are groups outside OpenSSF as well. Language is being shaped daily and we will need to keep adapting.
        * Andrew A: is there a summary or proposal?
        * Jay W: not yet, but wanted to get sense of interest before proceeding to docs / TAC approval.
        * CRob: EDU.SIG also is working on a glossary.  Would be great to join forces

        * Jacques: heartily recommends. 
        * Leitschuh: difficulty of identifying criticality. How about public availability of SBOM data?
        * Jim StClair: [suggested seminar from CSIS](https://www.csis.org/events/government-policies-open-source-software) . Suggested contacts among US Govt.
        * Andrew A: yes, we definitely want Govt-sector participants as part of our mission to have wide representation of end users
        * CRob: we could talk to Allan Friedman as a well-connected and interested in Enterprise view of SBOMs.
        * CRob: in Vuln Disc WG looking at whether to adopt [OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex). But lots of vendors don’t want their SBOMs to be public. So will probably be first to purchasers only, but we can begin to influence upstream projects.
        * Jim StClair: similar experience with medical device SBOMs and difficulty of determining who owns what and does what.
        * Andrew A: NY [Presby Hospital’s efforts talked about at last year’s SupplyChainSecurityCon](https://ossna2022.sched.com/event/11Q0t/sbom-ingestion-and-analysis-at-new-york-presbyterian-hospital-katie-bratman-adam-kojak-newyork-presbyterian-hospital).

<h4>Notes</h4>




* New friends: Rusydy Muhiddin; Roberth Strand
* **Updates on github pages** : these have been updated. [https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers) We need more in the “current work” section **[action] **- github pages are a good start, as many people will visit our work through this page. Anything where we’re looking for feedback…
* Multiple ad-hoc meetings - should these be published? Crob suggests yes - and to publish
* Dan to work on an issue template for the github repo** [action]**
* **Taxonomy update**: some disagreements on scope; one work call has taken place; went through supply chain attacks and tried to map these to the taxonomy… we felt we need to better define the scope;  

    * A couple of instances where an attack resulted in IP stolen, but no impact on the software produced; should our taxonomy include such an attack? Currently, it doesn’t. 
    * Impact on the “consumer” of the malicious code…  


    JM: “Lens” you’re looking at the taxonomy through - e.g. the attack tree - taxonomy depend on how you’re looking at it - from an attacker’s PoV, from a defender PoV… depending on that lens you have different groupings… We should put this on the community calendar to get others’ viewpoints…


     
Dan: feels like non-software-related attacks should be part of the taxonomy; also PoV should be end user…
 
Henrik: feels like this opens up a whole new taxonomy area for non-software-related attacks. 
 
Jacques: my gut instinct is to keep it simple and not include…  Expanding taxonomy to everything would make it unwieldy.  Have to have bounds. Should a meteorite hitting the data center be part of the taxonomy? My instinct would be to say no.  
 
JM: good conversation to have. In TAC we have kicked off a larger conversation. This is an open collaboration - also links to CNCF… We need to have a common conversation. 


* JM: **Supply chain attack repo**… I had a meeting with the Secure_ Repositories_ group. Good meeting, we need to continue the discussion. Some groups already have databases like this - we might be able to open it up and access…  

Question on data set - and ensuring any data provided is not seen as antitrust issue…  
 
Dan: use of “Open Data” license? 
 
Jason: cc0 or cc-by would be good, 
 
Jacques: I think a taxonomy would fit under community spec license 

* Crob: **report from the diagrammers’ society** [presents slides]: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xx-TblYarVTd3g7bLY4ifZx4OEhmSuQweqbjjPEgULw/edit#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xx-TblYarVTd3g7bLY4ifZx4OEhmSuQweqbjjPEgULw/edit#slide=id.p)  
Would you like to learn [more?]  

Crob: Governing board people love the _hierarchy view…_ Which I feel from a end user pov is not useful. I like the pers_ona view_… CI/CD one also pretty popular. 
 
JM: One thing I’d like to see: partial CI/CD, partial persona view : given an architecture, this is where the projects fit, the working groups fit, where things like Scorecards or SLSA fit…  
 
Crob: looking for more focus on what people find useful. We’d like to show project maturity… Another way to share info in a diagram. 
 
Roberth: in CNCF landscape - can be sorted … some of these more appealing - the bubbles one. The SDLC view as a concept. 
 
Crob: a pro designer would pick better colors… 
 
Roberth: can we choose a couple? 
 
Crob: yes absolutely… Also the group is open - if people want to make suggestions please feel free.  [https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society) The group meets every other Thursday at 3pm Eastern. If we have people from other timezones (Europe e.g.) we could reschedule. Calls recorded as well.

* Rob U: initiatives with capital markets, financial services… Happy to help. Recent [post about security - OSPO collaboration](https://www.robunderwood.com/2023/01/finos-board/). 

* JM: We’re having side meetings. We should bring that content into this call…  Going forward we’ll set these different meetings up but when we put the agenda it’ll be updates and active sessions on those topics.

<h4>Agenda</h4>




* Who will be scribe?
* Any new friends?
* JM - Update on proposals
    * Conversation with the TAC - we’re on the agenda for the 10th
* Action - setup call to discuss repository of threats with other interested groups (confirm with Jacques)
    * A call with different groups needs to be set up.  Where we collate threats to the supply chain - Provide that as a way of analyzing what we’re experiencing. Turned out multiple groups have thought of that - securing repos group. 
        * Securing software repositories
        * End users group
        * Identifying threats (“OSSIEMILATION” project)
        * [JM] - 
    * Jacques: Setting the infrastructure up could be a good project for a grad student … 
* Deliverables suggested at last meeting:
    * Finish architectures work
        * Set aside multiple architectures - regular end user; one where user doesn’t create software… 
    * Space for other users to share experiences
        * In CNCF - folks share their experiences of sharing CNCF tech - a useful forum for end users to e.g. talk about their use of SLSA.
        * Public stream? Make use of the “office hours” metaphor - LF staff can facilitate. Also something where people could speak under Chatham House Rule…
        * E.g. “how are we using SBOMs”
        * CRob : can take an action to talk to Marta who has been facilitating that - find the learnings.
    * End user guide for SBOM’s - creation and usage
        * Allan: Enduring Security Framework - NSA public-pivate partnership… done some work on SBOM but very high level. Focuses on what NSA corporate partners .. the high level challenge is - nobody has piles of SBOMs in their orgs… We don’t have lots of tools or standard op procedures… from a service provider perspective. We don’t have anything immediate.
            * [https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/17/2003116445/-1/-1/0/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_CUSTOMER.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/17/2003116445/-1/-1/0/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_CUSTOMER.PDF) 
        * CROB: Bressers & Kate in SBOMs everywhere SIG - they may want to collaborate - they have a diagram of the universe of SBOM tools.  [https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling) 
        * JM: anecdotally we need to put together info from the group on how people are using SBOMs…  Need to raise awareness of the supply chain threat and malicious packages… Not many people looking at ingestion. Raising awareness of the **malicious** software - specifically.
        * Jacques: 3 categories: production, accidentally vulnerable and deliberately vulnerable. “Package intelligence.”
        * JM: Raising awareness for starters - people are not aware of this problem. More looking at hardening a CI… not looking at malicious software. From Sonotype report we can see an increase in malicious software.
        * Abdullah: awareness and also procurement process… at the end of the day some people will bypass.
        * CROB: lots of channels we could use:
            * We have a platform - the OpenSSF blog - lots of insight there. A kickstart blog talking about the topic.
            * The OpenSSF NA cfp - (see below) - going to conferences - we may want to put together a panel or education session for that conference. In Vancouver in May. We could reuse that around the globe.
            * Feels like a useful Best Practices Guide - a deliverable of this group.
            * The Education SIG is putting together a plan to address developer / cybersecurity concerns.
        * Piergiorgio: capabilities we have so far - malicious samples - I tend to see often malware samples that have the same shape - low-effort attacks. 
        * Brian: lots of effort needed to train a model up to detect [malware]
        * Piergiorgio: we’ve seen packages that only contain malicious code, and projects clone existing software and include on malicious piece [line of code].
        * Brian: we can find heuristics - eg. starting off a project with a high version number. Drive-by committers… pytorch as an example. So many different ways.. Normal mature projects tend to have certain behaviours when they release. Attacks are low sophistication because we’re bad at blocking them. The supply chain tools don’t see it because the typo squatting projects aren’t getting picked up - even when developers pick them up.
        * JM: 2 pronged approach. Lots of interest in raising awareness.
        * Jonathan: socket.dev - example.
    * Feedback loop with auditors
        * Auditors asking questions about SBOMs… 
        * Allan: commercial 3rd party certification?
        * We want auditors to be asking for things that make sense
        * [no lead for now]
    * [crob] Looking at the end user git repo - suggest we get this in order - to document what the group is doing.
        * JM: Mitch was working on this.
* JM: **ACTIONS**: I will set up a group for threats; will work on raising awareness workstream.

    * [Allan] - **CISA SBOM Cloud group (Wednesday 3-4pm ET)** is focusing on what SBOM might mean for cloud applications, would love End User perspective
        * [crob] hyperscalers? Amazon, azure…?
        * _3 distinctions_: software dependencies; desire for greater transparency in full stack; if its a service then 3rd party service dependencies
        * Will start with a 5-pager “what does SBOM mean”? 
        * Notes from the CISA group: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZpTtsY0H2SwfNRq6qUzLMiWLQ8OwlhmJeg_M0cxrOiQ/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZpTtsY0H2SwfNRq6qUzLMiWLQ8OwlhmJeg_M0cxrOiQ/edit)

    * Jacques: mandatory mfa for packages for package repositories…  there was a line of argument that packaging systems can’t make those obligations on package maintainers… don’t agree with this… yes it imposes drag for package maintainers but for end users it can be catastrophic. I think this where some of this comes from. It’s gonna get bigger this year [because of 2fa].
    * CROB: this group could provide guidance on how consumers can manage the risk … the great MFA distribution - the foundation gave away tokens to maintainers… the foundation might be able to help / educate…
